UI/Style:

Use a minimal and modern visual style with intuitive navigation.
Primary colors: soft blue, white, gray tones.
Dark mode includes deep navy and dark gray backgrounds with clean text.
Typography should be simple and readable (e.g., “Inter” for English, “Alef” or “Assistant” for Hebrew).
Use subtle animations and transitions to enhance flow.
Icons should be flat and universal (use Material Icons or similar).

Sound: No sound effects to preserve the focused and private nature of the app.
